# TopMeOff

WoW vanilla addon (1.12.1) that will automatically top you off on reagents when you talk to a reagent vendor.

This addon works by checking your bags for stacks of consumables that are not topped off. It will then automatically purchase as many reagents as are necessary to complete these stacks.

## Usage

```
/tmo add <itemlink> <amount> - how much of the item you want to carry. You get an item link via shift-click.
/tmo ls - see the buy list
/tmo reset - reset the buy list
```
