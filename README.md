# TopMeOff

WoW vanilla addon (1.12.1) that will automatically top you off on reagents when you talk to a reagent vendor.

This addon works by checking your bags for stacks of consumables that are not topped off. It will then automatically purchase as many reagents as are necessary to complete these stacks.

## Usage

```
/tmo add <itemlink> <amount> - how much of the item you want to carry. You get an item link via shift-click.
/tmo ls - see the full buy list
/tmo ls need - see the items needed off the buy list
/tmo ls have - see the items you have from the buy list
/tmo del <itemlink> - remove 1 item from the list. You get an item link via shift-click.
/tmo reset - reset the buy list
```

Note: if you add a spirit zanza or ROIDS, the quest will auto-complete until you have enough.
